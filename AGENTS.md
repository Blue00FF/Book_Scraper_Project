## Overview
The Book_Scraper_Project is a Python web scraper that extracts book information from http://books.toscrape.com/. It allows users to select a genre and displays information about books in that genre, including title, rating, price, and link.

## Main Files

### Book_Scraper.py
This is the main script that performs the web scraping. Key components include:

1. **Categories List**: A comprehensive list of 56 book genres that users can choose from.
2. **Web Scraping**: Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract book information.
3. **User Interaction**: Uses PyInputPlus to create an interactive menu for genre selection.
4. **Data Extraction**: Extracts book title, rating, price, and link for each book in the selected genre.
5. **Output**: Prints book information to the console in a formatted way.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Uses regular expressions for reliable data extraction.
4. **User-Friendly Output**: Displays books in a numbered, formatted list.

## Dependencies
The project uses several Python libraries:
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- PyInputPlus for user input with validation
- Requests for HTTP requests
- Regular expressions for data extraction

## Project History
Based on git log, the project has gone through several commits:
1. Initial commit with basic functionality
2. Added requirements list
3. Added user choice of genre
4. Fixed vulnerabilities in requirements.txt

## How It Works
1. The script loads the main page of books.toscrape.com
2. It presents a menu of genres to the user
3. When a genre is selected, it navigates to that genre's page
4. It extracts information about all books in that genre
5. It displays the book information in a formatted console output

## Potential Improvements
1. Add support for pagination to scrape more than just the first page of books
2. Implement error handling for network requests
3. Add command-line arguments for non-interactive use
4. Save results to a file (CSV, JSON, etc.)
5. Add unit tests for the scraping functionality
